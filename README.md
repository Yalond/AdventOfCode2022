# Advent of Code 2022 - Rust solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the first 10 days of the Advent of Code 2022 challenge, written in Rust. This was my first time using Rust and I have to say, I really enjoyed it! 

However, I did find the borrow checker to be a bit confusing at times. But once I got the hang of it, I appreciated how Rust catches many common errors at compile time.

Each day's solution is contained in its own module, which can be run independently by running the corresponding binary.
